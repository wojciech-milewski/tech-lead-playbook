# Tech Lead Playbook

The Tech Lead Playbook is a set of values, tools and systems I've been using to help software engineering teams to be highly effective.

It's personal and heavily opinionated, but also based on experience and tests what's working and what's not. Please remember that every team is different, so the playbook needs to be adjusted to team's needs.

*Note:* The playbook isn't complete. There might be missing pieces, things aren't fully prioritised yet and not everything is well described.
